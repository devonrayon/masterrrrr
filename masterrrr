<p>May began with the annual City Debate, the trend of gin being the theme, which was very well attended by Liverymen and people from the City and press. I was pleased to see a number of Masters&nbsp; from other Livery Companies attending. It is an event that has become a key fixture on the City and Livery calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I was a guest of the Gin Guild for the annual Gin Industry dinner held in Guildhall the following week. The new Installations of members takes the total to 330 – a remarkable achievement in seven years.&nbsp;<br><br>I attended my first Old Codgers lunch&#8230; as a new member. This organisation brings together former executives from the drinks industry and it was an opportunity to catch up with industry luminaries I had not seen for some years. Our senior Liverymen occupy key positions in this August body.&nbsp;<br><br>On 15 May I attended the Royal Gala Dinner to celebrate the reopening of the Painted Hall at the Old Royal Navy College in Greenwich. This was in the presence of HRH The Princess Royal who spoke about the important role the Royal Naval College has played through history and its importance to the Royal Family – especially her father who was made Baron Greenwich on the morning of his wedding and who spent time there as an officer.&nbsp;<br><br>The following day the ancient Guildable Manor of Southwark held a “Legal”! dinner for senior members of the legal profession to which the Mistress and I were invited. The guest speaker was Lady Hale President Head of&nbsp; the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. The dinner was held in Southwark at Amigo Hall and followed their ancient tradition including the sought after roles of Ale taster and Flesh taster (the latter referring to meat and the responsibility to sample what we were about to receive as a main course in full view of all present to ensure it was of good quality and bore no trace of poison.).&nbsp;<br><br>During the weekend if the 18th May the Mistress and I were invited to join the Anglo Normand Squadron of the Compagnie des Mousquetaires d’Armagnac who were holding their annual event for the first time in Cambridge at Christ’s College.&nbsp;<br>This was the chance for me to represent the British Squadron of Les Mousquetaires which was formed last year and to walk through the streets of Cambridge in the cloak and sash of the Compagnie alongside other Capitaine&nbsp;Lieutenants from countries such as Belgium Switzerland Holland and Turkey.&nbsp;<br><br>The 21st May was the afternoon of the Buckingham Palace Garden Party to which we with other Masters and Mistresses were invited. This was preceded by a lunch organised by the Master Actuary which as his profession would suggest had been planned well in advance of the date!&nbsp;<br><br>A most convivial event from which we all moved effortlessly into the gardens of the Palace and awaited Her Majesty who appeared on the stroke of 4pm along with other prominent members of the Royal Family. It was a glorious early summer afternoon the supplies of tea and sandwiches were plentiful and militarybands accompanied the festivities.&nbsp;<br><br>The Master Baker invited the Learned Clerk and myself to a Master and Clerks lunch at Bakers Hall during which witty speeches between the Master and Clerk were exchanged – based on the traditional mutual respect between the two roles!<br><br>Sides in the exchanges were taken by those present with the Masters of course being correct in all their observations about the irreplaceable and ancient role of the Clerk and the way it is (occasionally) undertaken today. All agreed that the Masters are always right&#8230;.<br><br>The Master Baker reminded me that yeast was a key component in the production of spirits and that perhaps the Bakers should be considered as potential Cask Group Members. We are keen to revive The Cask Group of drinks related Liveries, so this may be an opportunity.&nbsp;<br><br>The Master Baker generously served Jameson Irish Whiskey at his convivial Stirrup cup during the afternoon and as an Ulsterman he was also keen on Bushmills a whiskey whose iconic location by the Giants Causeway is legendary.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We were invited by the Master and Mistress of the Cutlers of Hallamshire to their annual Feast in Sheffield in their magnificent Cutlers Hall. This imposing Victorian Hall in the central historic part of the city directly opposite the Cathedral contains treasures and artefacts gathered over the centuries including many items of Sheffield hall marked silver and silver plate.<br><br>It also contains Art Deco doors and light fittings from the ocean going liner and sister ship to the <em>Titanic</em>&nbsp;– <em>the Olympic</em>.&nbsp;<br><br>The Guest Speaker was David Liddington number two in the government to Theresa May, who made the journey on the eve of her resignation as Prime Minister. Leading figures from business industry and the public sector as well as 25 Masters and Consorts of London Livery Companies were present.&nbsp;<br><br>The following day a visit to a steel producer in Rotherham had been organised. We witnessed a very mechanised and computer driven process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This gave a fascinating insight into heavy industry and why its continuing role remains important to the UK and the development of our infrastructure. <br><br>An invitation to attend the Major General’s Review at Horse Guards Parade from the London Regiment A Company (London Scottish) our Military Affiliate rounded off the month very well. This is a dress rehearsal for the Trooping of the Colour with everyone present except the Queen. <br><br>The music choreography and horsemanship on display from the servicemen and women on parade was of the highest standard and fiercely impressive when one considers they practice their roles in this Ceremony for only six weeks and the rest of the time they are defending our country. <br><br>Our London Scottish Liaison Liveryman James Higgins and I attended a lunch afterwards as the guests of London Scottish at their historic HQ in Victoria where pipers entertained us and mortar and machine gun crews explained in detail the reality of life in the field after deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.  <br><br>Their motto &#8220;Strike Sure&#8221; is one they live and fight by and as a part of the London Reserve Regiment they come from all walks of life and professions and are ready to serve when the call comes. <br>Inspiring and impressive.</p>

<p>The month began with an interesting lecture hosted by the Worshipful Company of Educators – the subject being the Defence Education Revolution and the need for creative thinking in times of war and peace.</p>



<p>The Mistress and I were the guests of the Keepers of the Quaich at their Spring Banquet in the magnificent castle at Blair Atholl – its grand banqueting hall is the largest in all the castles of Scotland and suitably adorned with hunting trophies and antlers.&nbsp;It was a magnificent occasion where Scotch whisky is celebrated and attended by Keepers and Masters of the Quaich from around the world.&nbsp;PM Brian Morrison had persuaded me to wear the Master’s Gown for the procession of the top table guests into the Hall, which he assured me would make the Distillers’ Company presence noticed. It seemed to work.</p>



<p>Andrew Neil, the journalist and TV personality was the guest speaker and I was questioned by him about the Master’s Chain and Gown – although in a friendly tone and not the one he adopts when interrogating politicians.&nbsp;His speech focused on the importance of business entrepreneurs to our economy – as represented by many in the room.</p>



<p>Our April Dinner was in Saddlers’ Hall, a most impressive hall which holds a magnificent collection of historic saddles.&nbsp;The Princess Royal is Master of the Company ‘in perpetuity’, an honour bestowed in recognition of her passion for equestrian activities.&nbsp;The Prime Warden is the equivalent position to the annual Master.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Learned Clerk rose to the challenge of playing the piano for the “Sung Grace” which is a tradition for the majority of Livery Companies, but one which the Distillers have let slip.&nbsp;Historically we did sing the “Livery Grace” from the “Laudi Spirituali” written in 1545.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Esteemed Clerk hastily assembled a Clerks’ Choir to lead the singing, which appropriately they did from the Minstrels’ Gallery.&nbsp;And for an encore they led the singing of the National Anthem – following the Loyal Toast.&nbsp;There were six Masters and two Past Masters present as guests – including a Master Musician – all of whom commented positively on the hearty voices of the Distillers and the Choir of Clerks.&nbsp;I hope we can now maintain this excellent addition to our celebrations and Banquets.</p>



<p>The following day was the Official Opening by the Duke of Sussex of the Future Zone, an OnSide Youth Centre in Dagenham.&nbsp;The Distillers contributed £50k to this venture, funds generated by our Whisky Auction in April 2018 which contributed to the Lord Mayor’s Appeal.&nbsp;It was exactly one year ago that the Auction had taken place and the Lord Mayor was present at the Opening where he presented a plaque to me, on behalf of the Company, in grateful thanks for our contribution.&nbsp;A second plaque is a fixture in the building, alongside those of other sponsors.&nbsp;Prince Harry spent over two hours touring the impressive facility, with state of the art sporting and musical equipment, and was thoroughly engaged when talking to the local young people, several of whom had helped design the interior of the building and who had chosen “Future” as their theme.</p>



<p>From then onto our Armagnac Tasting which was held at the Scotch Malt Whisky Society in Hatton Garden.&nbsp;20 Liverymen and guests attended – a full house – for a tasting which included 40 year old Armagnacs…</p>



<p>The Big Curry Lunch took place in Guildhall sponsored by the Lord Mayor in support of the Army Benevolent Fund and other forces charities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Livery Companies took advantage of the occasion to display their wares and sell items for charity.&nbsp;The Lord Mayor’s Reserve English Single Malt Whisky, produced by Liveryman Daniel Szor at Cotswolds Distillery, was on sale, and doing a brisk trade.&nbsp;I was delighted to be invited to officially open the new Visitors’ Centre at Cotswolds Distillery later in the month, at a well attended event, followed by a tour of the Distillery producing gin, whisky and speciality spirits.</p>



<p>The month ended with a short visit to Armagnac to finalise details for the forthcoming Court Visit in early June.&nbsp;The Mistress and I met with the National Armagnac Bureau, the Mousquetaires of Armagnac and stayed at the hotel where we will be based for our visit.&nbsp;We sampled some excellent Armagnacs and were introduced to the unique ‘apéritif gascon’ comprising Armagnac and grape juice, made by only one family in Gascony using traditional methods.&nbsp;This took place in the pretty village of Fourcès during a flower festival which uniquely boasts a round Medieval square in the centre of the village.</p>

<p>March began with a ceremony in Guildhall Yard with the Lord Mayor and Master Gardener hosting the Duke of Kent in the opening of a small garden in the form of a maze produced by the Worshipful Company of Gardeners.&nbsp;&nbsp;The maze symbolises the mental state veterans sometimes find themselves in when trying to reestablish their lives after combat and PTSD. This event was in support of the Big Curry Lunch, a charity event now in its 12th year which takes place in April.<br><br>The proceeds of the Big Curry Lunch are in aid of the Army Benevolent Lunch and will be focused on financing care in pain management in conjunction with King Edward VII Hospital.&nbsp;<br><br>A visit to Glasgow at the invitation of the Visitor of the Incorporation of Maltmen – one of the 14 trades and craft guilds in Glasgow – was a lively event. Excellent hospitality with music, much singing and many speeches in the splendid Trades Hall.&nbsp;<br><br>An evening of entertainment at the Old Bailey in Court Number 1 featured comic vignettes of famous trials played by former Sheriffs, Liverymen and legal luminaries in support of the Sheriffs and Recorders Charity Fund.&nbsp;<br><br>The annual event with the Master and Wardens of the Vintners was this year a lunch hosted by the Vintners in their Court room was followed by a tour of their cellars. A most convivial event which cements the close relationship between these two great Livery Companies.&nbsp;<br><br>A visit to Dagenham to see the new On Side Youth Zone building which will be opened in April. The preview given to members of our Charity Committee was as a result of the £50,000 contribution we made to the building from the proceeds of the Charity Auction last year and which is part of the Lord Mayor&#8217;s Appeal. A state of the art building designed to keep young people off the streets in a safe space contains sport and music facilities with people on hand to help them with any personal challenges and to develop opportunities.&nbsp;<br><br>The positive, encouraging quotations and slogans which appear inside the building are chosen by young people themselves who have helped in the design of the building and present a, &#8220;Yes we can&#8221; approach to life.&nbsp;<br><br>In the same week a visit to Treloars School in Alton, Hampshire with the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs along with Masters and Mistresses form many Livery Companies was equally inspiring. The residential school founded in 1907 by Lord Mayor Sir William Treloars is dedicated to educating and supporting severely disabled children from the ages of 2-22.&nbsp;<br><br>All students there have complex medical conditions and the vast majority are constantly in wheelchairs. The school has been supported by the City Corporation and Lord Mayor and by Livery Companies including the Distillers. The staff of 800 are dedicated to improving the lives of the 183 residents with patience understanding and professionalism.&nbsp;<br><br>The visit finished with a concert performed by some of the students using specially adapted instruments and supported by remarkable software packages which enable notes to be struck by the blink of an eye.&nbsp;<br><br>The Lord Mayor hosted a banquet at Mansion House for Masters and Consorts and gave a speech which focused on the important role of Livery companies today. He highlighted the 3 &#8220;S &#8220;which define this role – skills / standards/ social responsibility.&nbsp;<br><br>The following day was the annual United Guild Service at St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral. All the Livery Companies are represented – the Masters in gowns and chains of office and their Consorts sitting under the huge dome. Wardens and Liverymen also attend the service.&nbsp;<br><br>Following this the Distillers traditionally go to Brewers Hall for lunch together with the Brewers and Coopers. This is a most convivial and relaxed event&nbsp;where beer is served alongside wine and the loyal toast is always made in beer.<br><br>I made a speech which celebrated the association between the Brewers Distillers and Coopers &#8211; not only because of the connection in our respective products but also the strong link reflected in our membership of the Cask Group which we all wish to build on.</p>

<p>February has been busy for activities within our Company and in the Livery world. The February Court meeting was preceded by a meeting of the MALT group (Military Affiliates Liaison Team) at which the activities of all our military affiliates were reviewed. These will be communicated to the Livery though regular updates on the website and newsletters. A lot is happening. <br></p>



<p>At the Court meeting we admitted four new Liverymen who were the first to receive the new Liveryman certificate. Paul Hick, David Croll and brothers Iain and John Stirling. It was considered by the Court to be appropriate to mark the admission into the Livery with a certificate as we are one of the few Companies not to do this. Our thanks to Damian Riley- Smith for his help in their design and production. It is planned to make available these certificates for existing Liverymen at a nominal charge for those who may regret not having received one in their admission to the Livery. More details will be given in due course. We also welcomed onto the Court as Court Assistants Garvin Brown IV and Justin Hicklin. Trevor Stirling became a Steward.<br></p>



<p>Major Jamie Barklem of London Scottish Regiment and Commander Duncan Thomas of 825 NAS were presented with the Company Freedom as was Dr Dawn Maskell Director of the International Centre for Brewing and Distilling of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. Gary Horsfield of William Grant received his Freedom as a Corporate Associate.</p>



<p>The lunch at Vintners Hall was very well attended and our guest speaker Tony Hales who had been CEO of the Allied Domecq Group in the 1990s explained how exciting and unconventional the marketing of spirits had been at that time in the emerging markets of Asia Eastern Europe and Russia.</p>



<p>We were joined at the Stirrup Cup by the Mistress and Consorts who had been lunching at Innholders&#8217; Hall and who with their guest speaker Fiona Adler, a recent Sheriff&#8217;s Consort, were offered a warming glass of whisky, port or Armagnac. However, it transpired they had already had enjoyed a glass of Armagnac at Innholders to help them on their way to us!</p>



<p>I was pleased to introduce the new Development Director Clive Bairsto to the Livery during the lunch and for Clive be to be able to meet many Liverymen during the Stirrup Cup. Clive will join us formally in mid March working on a part time basis to help implement the many projects we have identified in our strategic plan and will be briefed by the Master and Wardens as part of his induction schedule.</p>



<p>Indeed, Clive has already attended a meeting of the Industry Committee as part of this pre-joining induction, as well as being present at the Gin Magazine Awards, where I was delighted to present PM Hayman with the prestigious Gin Magazine Hall of Fame Award. The previous winner was PM Maxwell!</p>



<p>I have been invited to many events during the month including the Installation Dinner of the Master Marketor in Drapers Hall and the 450 th anniversary of the Worshipful Company of Basketmakers at the Guildhall. An exhibition of their work was opened by the Duchess of Gloucester, which included the giant wicker figures of Gog and Magog which stood at the entrance to the Guildhall. These two mythical figures are the traditional guardians of the City of London and have appeared in the Lord Mayors Show since the reign of Henry V. These wicker figures were made by Liverymen from the Worshipful Company of Basketmakers a few years ago. <br>Gog and Magog are also represented permanently as wooden statues in the Guildhall. They are descended from mythical pagan giants and their origins lie in the medieval legends of the early British Kings as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12 century which tells of the formation of Albion or Britain itself. Their adoption by the Guildhall and the Lord Mayor symbolise, &#8220;Defending the honour of their country and the liberties of this their City&#8221; as described in the, &#8220;Gigantick History of the two famous Giants &#8221; written in 1741.</p>



<p>The high point of the month was the Channel Dash Commemorative Lunch hosted by Commander Duncan Thomas at 825 NAS in Yeovilton. The story of exceptional bravery and courage by the 18 men of the Fleet Air Arm in 1942 who took on the might of the Luftwaffe and the German fleet in their flimsy Swordfish planes each equipped with a torpedo is inspirational for its daring and self sacrifice. A 96 year old Swordfish veteran was present to tell us what it felt like to be in a Swordfish during armed conflict. We were all humbled by his stories and his manner, which was an uplifting combination of modesty humour and fortitude.<br><br>The month ended with two fascinating lectures chaired by different Livery Companies. The Glass Sellers in Middle Temple hosted a lecture by a leading surging Sir Roger Kneebone on the theme of, &#8220;Thinking with our hands&#8221; and the importance of a steady hand in all craftsmanship – whether it be surgery or glass engraving.<br></p>



<p>The World Traders invited Christine Lagarde, the Head of the International Monetary Fund, to deliver a lecture in the Guildhall on, &#8220;Redefining  a Broader Sense of Purpose for the Financial Sector.&#8221; Mme Lagarde was clear in her message that finance needs to be at the service of business and people and not the other way round – and she successfully avoided any reference at all to Brexit during the evening – much to the relief of all present! </p>

<p>January began well with an “eat through” of the menu we have chosen for the February Livery lunch.&nbsp;I was joined in this endeavour by the Mistress, the Assistant Clerk and Liveryman Jonathan Orr-Ewing. All with discerning taste.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those attending the February lunch will make their own judgement, but we were content!</p>



<p>It put an abrupt and early end to any notion of dry January (I wondered whether Dry January is a marketing ploy to encourage the consumption of Dry Martini cocktails – or Dry sherry?).&nbsp;From there it was a short walk to the Industry Committee meeting at the WSET offices in Bermondsey St.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Master and Wardens Meeting preceded the Benevolent Lunch in Vintners Hall a few days later and the month was becoming less Dry by the day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Invited by PM Hayman (who is also an PM of&nbsp; the Upholders ) to a dinner of the Worshipful Company of Upholders in Bakers Hall -one which was destroyed during the Blitz and the first to be rebuilt in a modern style in 1963 -..the Master Baker the Master Painter Stainer and Master of the Tim Plate and Wire Workers were also present .</p>



<p>The Master Upholder remarked in his speech that we had a connection going back many years as he had produced the labels for Beefeater Gin and we had first met during the 1980s .</p>



<p>In most Livery Companies there is a Sung Grace before the speeches. This is in addition to the spoken grace preceding the dinner. It is the same “Livery Grace” used by all Livery Companies- The 16th century Laudi Spirituali.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am not sure why the Distillers do not follow this tradition &#8211; especially as we are the Livery of Spirits we have such fine voices . Something for us to consider?</p>



<p>I had the opportunity to present the Distillers Prizes to two winners for outstanding results achieved in WSET spirit examinations.</p>



<p>This took place in the Guildhall and was very well attended .It demonstrates the enthusiasm and commitment of the educators and students for the study of wines and spirits and the success of the WSET.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The Worshipful Company of Marketors Installation Dinner took place in Draper’s Hall one of the grandest and most richly decorated Halls in the City.<br></p>



<p>I was one of eight different Masters to be invited and as I am also a Liveryman of this Company it was a pleasure to see many old friends there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Marketors have a well established mentoring programme which extends beyond their own Livery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I hope we can arrange a joint event of some kind with them during the course of the year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PM Watling and I visited the crypt of St Martin in the Fields in Trafalgar Square where the memorial and imposing bust of our Founder Sir Theodore de Mayerne is located. Sir Theodore was a remarkable man born in Geneva in 1573.&nbsp;A highly successful physician to the royal families in France and England he knew many famous people of the period from the poet John Donne to Cardinal Richelieu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a successful entrepreneur and wealthy man he was also a philanthropist and worshipped at St Martin in the Fields – his local Church.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will return to the life and influence of the Founder in future blogs. We owe a lot to him&nbsp;– or we might still be part of the Apothecaries Company!</p>



<p>Many internal meetings have taken place since the start of the year on different subjects as our Company continues to evolve.&nbsp;The month finished with a visit to Armagnac with the Mistress to make final preparations for the Court visit in June.</p>

<p>My first Master’s blog starts with the Installation Dinner, and the transfer of Mastership from Bryan Burrough, which is very well reported in the accompanying article by Emma Fox.  It was a most memorable and enjoyable event.</p>



<p>The first engagement for the Mistress and myself was an exhibition of the Woodturners craft, hosted by the Worshipful Company of Turners.  Examples of work by Liverymen and craftsmen were on display, including live displays of woodturning.  The famous artist Gabor Lacko was signing books of his work – a lifetime of artistry.  His work “Russian Bells” proved too tempting.  We left the exhibition poorer, but happy.</p>



<p>Later that week, the Mistress and I were joined by the Clerk and Assistant Clerk for the “Swan Feast” at Vintners’ Hall as guests of the Master and Wardens.</p>



<p>This is a splendid occasion which celebrated the right of Vintners to eat swan – a delicacy which was the preserve of the Monarchy from medieval times.  Henry VIII conferred this honour on the Vintners, which is the focus of the celebration.</p>



<p>A model feathered swan is presented to the Master by the chef during the dinner – accompanied by musicians playing medieval instruments and dressed as minstrels of the period.</p>



<p>The next formal event was as a guest of the Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks, whose main event is the feast of St Nicholas, preceded by a church service at the St James Garlickhythe.  The Feast took place in the sumptuous surroundings of the Grocers Hall. One original aspect of the Dinner is the ‘Cross Toasting’, where Liverymen all rise simultaneously to toast different individuals, shouting the name of their Parish. The result is a cacophony.  A Liveryman in this Company must be a Clerk of a Parish in the City of London, or a handful of parishes in London outside the City.   There are currently 89 Liverymen.</p>



<p>I left the dinner to take the Caledonian Sleeper to Edinburgh for the Scottish Committee meeting the following morning. We granted the Freedom of the Company to 3 members of the Scottish Distilling Industry.  Ken Grier, the driving force over the last 20 years behind much of the success of The Macallan, and Ian and John Stirling, the brothers who have established the Arbikie distillery near Montrose.</p>



<p>This was followed by the Whisky of Icons lunch held in Surgeons’ Hall in Edinburgh, hosted by Liveryman Damian Riley-Smith and Paragraph Publishing.  Ken Grier received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the lunch. I was invited to make a short speech about the Livery and I was happy to congratulate the Scottish Committee for the strength of our thriving Scottish Membership. Probably unique among City Livery Companies, almost 20% of our active membership is based in Scotland.</p>



<p>The following week, our Learned Clerk accompanied me to the Installation Dinner of the Master of the Glass Seller at Stationers’ Hall.  Our Company and the Glass Sellers are members of the Cask Group – an informal association of Livery companies with a common interest in the drinking and hospitality trade.  The group comprises of The Vintners, Brewers, Coopers, Glass Sellers, Innholders and ourselves.</p>



<p>Our Distillers Carol Service and dinner last week was very enjoyable and it was wonderful to see so many Liverymen and guests singing heartfully, especially when our Learned Clerk led us all in a rendition of ‘We wish you a Merry Christmas’ to send us on our way.</p>



<p>The next day at the Sanctuary the Wardens, Clerk and I granted the Freedom of the Company to David Croll of the Kyoto Gin Distillery in Japan.</p>



<p>The Lord Mayor hosted a festive event at the Mansion House in the week before Christmas. It was a celebration of ‘Scrooge’ and a Christmas Carol with readings by Simon Callow, who is an enthusiast for Charles Dickens. As we entered the luxurious Egyptian Hall, drinks were proffered. At first glance, I thought it must be a very pale white wine or perhaps a glass of gin? After all, gin was very popular in Victorian times and taken neat. But on tasting it, imagine our surprise to discover it was water and the canapé which accompanied it was a water biscuit!</p>



<p>The Lord Mayor was determined to create the right mood for an appreciation of the themes of Dickens’ Scrooge. But redemption, as for Scrooge, did appear after the readings when Champagne and canapés were served.  Mark Dickens, the great great grandson of the author was also present.</p>



<p>The Lord Mayor had made his point. The event was after all intended to support his Charity Appeal, including On Side Youth Centres to which we have contributed and some of whose members were present.</p>



<p>We were delighted to purchase a bottle of the Lord Mayor’s Reserve, Cotswold English Whisky, produced by our Liveryman Daniel Szor, in support of the Lord Mayor’s Appeal.</p>



<p>The Mistress and I would like to wish all Liverymen and their families a very happy Christmas and a most fulfilling and enjoyable New Year.</p>



<p>As Tiny Tim said in A Christmas Carol – ‘God bless us, Every one’.  </p>

<p>Another busy month to finish my year. I was delighted to be asked to be a Guard of Honour at the Lord Mayor’s Show. This entailed greeting the new Lord Mayor at Mansion House when he returned from the parade and then having lunch in Mansion House. This followed a number of events with the Lord Mayors over the previous days. Firstly the outgoing Lady Mayoress hosted a thank you drinks party for all her supporters during the year, this included Pauleen Morton, who had raised money for the Lady Mayoress by swimming. Then the day before the Lord Mayor’s Show there was the Silent Ceremony in Guildhall with the swearing in of the new Lord Mayor. Other than his oath, everything is done in silence with many participants having to walk backwards. Yes we know how to put on a ceremony. That evening we had our Past Masters Association dinner. This year’s association is called the Spitfires and our consorts our Merlins and is a great way to keep in touch with all the Masters and Consorts you have met over the year. The dinner included an Elvis impersonator and plenty of dancing.</p>



<p>It was fun to finish the year with a number of musical events, Philippa and I went to a Tchaikovsky recital at the Guildhall Art Gallery with readings from his life read by Simon Callow. My last day as Master saw many Masters and Wardens attend the Festival of St Cecilia run by the charity Help Musicians UK.</p>



<p>I chaired my final meeting as Chair of our Investment Working Group. We decided to invest the £100,000 raised by our charity whisky auction. The Distillers’ Charity endowment now stands at over £1 million, which is a milestone we set a number of years ago. Our investment managers Cazenove invited me to their Charity Conference, which included looking into the future at ideas such as facial recognition and only insuring your car when you drive it.</p>



<p>I was invited to the IWSC Presidents Dinner and was sat next door to Facundo Bacardi. We worked out that our great grandfathers started their respective drinks businesses a year apart. It reminded me of our City Debate topic of family against publicly controlled companies.</p>



<p>The end of a wonderful year as Master ends with the Installation dinner and Martin Riley being installed as the new Master. I was also delighted to welcome the assistant Clerk into the livery. The Installation dinner shows off our livery at its best and I know the Company is in safe hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A busy month. My German is non-existent, so giving a speech in German sets the pulse racing. That is what I had to do at the annual banquet of our affiliate the Zunft zu Rebleuten in Basel, Switzerland. Nicola Riley very kindly helped on the phonetics. The Rebleuten guild is 700 years old and they are the vine owners and wine makers from around Basel, hence our connection. Their Master, Edi Etter, is one of our liverymen and he is stepping down as the Rebleuten’s Master after 15 years. The banquet is like a men-only, livery company with many speeches and singing. New members have to drink half a bottle of white wine from a wolf statue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds like an idea we could replicate in the Distillers!</p>



<p>The Mansion House Banquet is always a special moment in our calendar. I was proud to be able to present the Lord Mayor with a cheque for £50,000. This is part of the proceeds from our charity whisky auction and is being used to support the Onside Youth Zone being built in a deprived part of Dagenham. Hopefully liverymen will get a chance to see this amazing new youth club in the New Year.</p>



<p>I have been pleased how our military affiliations have prospered this year. We entertained the London Scottish Regiment to a whisky tasting tutored brilliantly by Kenny Mackay. The London Jocks seemed to enjoy themselves. We were reciprocated with an invite to their Hallowe’en Dinner, which commemorates the regiment’s brave stand at Messines in the First World War, when they were given the wrong ammunition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other livery company invites this month included the Vintage Festival service at St James Garlickhythe, followed by lunch at Vintners’ Hall. It is a nice way to celebrate the harvest with the other drink liveries (Vintners and Brewers). The Musician’s Company Evensong at St. Paul’s Cathedral sees a fantastic turnout from the livery world and it is an enjoyable evening. The Painter Stainers’ Company had an art exhibition, from predominantly their liverymen, and the standard was high.</p>



<p>There was the normal round of internal Committee meetings. The Charity Committee focussed on an initiative for us to reinvigorate our support for vocational education within the spirits industry. The Industry Committee continues to concentrate on how we recruit and work with the thriving spirits industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master &amp; Wardens’ Committee runs through the nuts and bolts of how we run the Company and how we are currently recruiting a Development Director.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally the Master and Wardens carried out the age old tradition of inspecting a London Distillery. It had to be Beefeater at Montford Place. I am pleased to say they passed their inspection and so can continue to produce 3 million cases of gin a year. Passing the inspection probably made it easier for our host, liveryman Desmond Payne, to entertain 30 liverymen and their guests to a gin tasting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the highlight of the month was the Scottish dinner. Over 160 people attended a lively gathering at the Signet Library in Edinburgh. The toast to the guests was proposed by our Honorary Freeman –  Lord Robertson of Port Ellen. A fantastic speech, I think he has had a bit of practice over the years. The guest speaker was Finlay Calder, former Captain of the British &amp; Irish Lions. The Stirrup Cup lasted well into the night and people seemed to go home with smiles on their faces.</p>



<p>This month has seen a piece of history take place for our Company. Honorary Freeman, Vincent Keaveny, became the Aldermanic Sheriff of the City of London. The Distillers have not had a Sheriff of the City of London for over 50 years and if Vincent continues to progress he may well be Lord Mayor in a few years’ time, the first Distiller for over 150 years. I first attended the presentation of his shrieval chain, which includes the Distillers crest in his badge. Then I was privileged to be one of his six supporters at the Admission of Sheriffs ceremony at Guildhall, which was followed by a sumptuous Sheriffs’ Breakfast.</p>



<p>On a more sombre note, many Distillers attended the funeral of Court Assistant Chris Parker down in Surrey. Chris was past Chairman of the Industry Committee and the founder of the Gin Guild. He was always great fun with a wise head on him and will be sorely missed. I also attended a World War One exhibition by the London Scottish Regiment. Again a reminder of how many laid down their lives for this country in the Great War. The War Memorial lists nearly 1,500 men, a terrible loss for one regiment.</p>



<p>Finally I attended the Glass Sellers’ dinner hosted by their Master John Poulten. As a fellow Essex man there was a definite Essex feel to it. The guest speaker was the Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Essex and Sheriff Neil Redcliffe and his wife Emma both hail from the County.</p>
